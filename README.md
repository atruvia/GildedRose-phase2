This repository contains a customized version of the gilded rose kata. We see the kata as a two-staged one: First, the code must be made readable by using the refactoring options of your IDE and then in the next step, a refactoring with the focus of a clean design should be concerned. This repository includes a version of Kata where the simple refactorings have already been done. In addition, tests have been added, but not all! So getting into this kata is to add the missing tests first...
